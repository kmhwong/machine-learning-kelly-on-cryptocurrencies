# machine-learning-kelly-on-cryptocurrencies

This is a student research project of Centre for Financial Engineering of The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2021.

The project consists of two parts. Part I is an exploration of the predictive power of various machine learning methods in the context of cryptocurrencies (although some stock prices were also examined for control purposes). In Part II we applied the Kelly Strategy for crypto trading and tested the result using the package Backtrader.
The pioneering attempt of this project is to estimate the probability of up/down trend implied in Part I and apply the probability as an input in Kelly Strategy in Part II.

The result of each part is inside the respective folder. However, I have to confess that the current form is still primitive and subject to further polishment.
